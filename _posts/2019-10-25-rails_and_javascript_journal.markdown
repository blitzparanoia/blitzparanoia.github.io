After completing the Rails and Javascript project I took note of several things...

### The Importance of Ensuring the Little Things 
At this stage there are several little additions that are needed. It is imporant  to make sure all the ruby gems are added such as bcrypt, jquery-rails and the serializers gem. One thing that had me stuck for a while was simply forgetting to incorporate the jquery script line into the application file.

### Proper Planning
It is vital to start by brainstorming the project. This means mapping out the potential features, making a chart of the associations and the columns of the table. It is also necessary to consider thinking of the user flow (how the user interacts with the website). Poor planning can lead to headaches and future confusion.

### Back to the Basics 
Conventions are the basis. Making sure to follow CRUD and cleaning up Ruby code by refactoring (after the program is functioning).

### Try Not to Get Carried  Away
I had focused on the features at hand to meet the project requiements. This is not a loss but the potential to add more to the app. I would surely go back to improve, add more features and refine the app when time provides.

### Errors Are Friends
Having progress this far I have become more comfortable with errors. They are like little pushes in the right direction. They are hints to the puzzle. It takes some time to get comfortable embracing error messages. Error messages should be read carefully to assist in figuring out solutions.

### Overall
It was fun to learn yet another lanuage. Javascript is amazing because of how many different approaches there are to get results. I am finally feeling like an engineer and proud that I am learning this new skill.
