Technology is the monster that has infiltrated my life from the moment I wake to the minute I decide to sleep. From the computer, tablet and the ever present smartphone that is always at my fingertips. Over time I had become increasingly interested and fascinated on how the devices came to be.

I have always been a self-proclaimed researcher. Looking things up and using the Internet to learn with hopes of gaining new skills. I have in the past wet my feet with HTML/CSS when the Internet was not as complex as we know it today. However, that curiosity and adventurous fun had not faded. I found myself recently spending my weekends refreshing my memory of HMTL/CSS, looking up other programming languages and becoming overall intrigued. 

It was like a spark turned into a flame within myself.  Weekends learning to code began to sound more exciting than my usual work. I realized it was not out of reach; it is never to late. It was then that I decided to take initiative; taking the leap to applying to a coding boot camp.  The thought of having a challenging mentally stimulating career is my newest goal. I am looking forward to everything this learning track has to offer from the material to meeting new people.
